      <description>I spend a considerable amount of time on my computer, whether that is healthy or not is another issue but one thing that I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed is after working on writing or working on code my wrists will start to hurt. Combine this with a friend of mine getting Carpal Tunnel and the glory that is mechanical keyboards and you have me new interest in custom mechanical keyboards.
Ultimately the goal is to build a custom mechanical keyboard with a more ergonomic layout and maybe some custom keybinds.</description>
