      <description>The third project we completed for my freshman introductory mechanical engineering course was a line following robot. Modelled after the Mobot races that are traditionally part of CMU&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Carnival&amp;rdquo; (https://www.cs.cmu.edu/mobot/).
The playlist below contains some of the tests while developing the controls for the bot. The objective was to complete the about 7 ft track autonomously and stop 15cm from the box at the end. We managed to do both, completing the task in the fastest recorded time of about 7 seconds.</description>
