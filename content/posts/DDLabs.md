I built a 4 quadrant dynamometer (essentially a treadmill for cars) to test the performance of
DoorDash lab's indevelopment autonomous delivery robots. I worked on electrical design, building the
platform from first principles to be able to simulate different loads and road conditions for
development and repair validation. I also developed software and firware to drive the brushless
motor we used to drive the dyno and to simulate different loads.
The following year, I focused on developing controls to allow the motor to accurately follow torque
and velocity profiles. I also built an interface for non-technical personnel to use the dyno for
testing.
