    <h1 id="problem">Problem:</h1>
<p>I know very little about machine learning and artificial intelligence. In an effort to get my feet wet in a somewhat practical way (excluding the tutorials from pytorch, etc) I wanted to see if I could create a object recognition system that wasn&rsquo;t just a clone of an old paper.</p>
<p>Object recognition systems are already highly accurate, but one potential area for improvement could be the time it takes to recognize an object.</p>
<h1 id="solution">Solution:</h1>
<p>The idea functions on the basis that a system recognizing objects from a smaller subset would be more accurate than a more general system.</p>
<p>To that end, I was thinking about a three stage system:
Stage 1: A traditional CNN-based image recognition system
Stage 2: Evaluate the scene or situational context based on the items identified with the highest confidence level
Stage 3: Adjust the confidence of the detected objects using a probabalistic heuristic</p>
<p>One approach to the heuristic could be object coincidence probabilities, that is how often objects appear in the same scene or context.</p>
<p>An alternative approach would be to use a secondary classifier to identify a potential context and use that to adjust confidences based on what objects are likely to be in these contexts.</p>
<h1 id="where-im-at">Where I&rsquo;m At:</h1>
<p>This ended up being a larger time commitment than I originally anticipated. The course I was planning to take to get a better background in machine learning was also cancelled so I&rsquo;ve been relying on self study and its a bit slow going.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve selected CenterNet MobileNet v2 as the first stage, and I was planning to evaluate its performance in comparison to other methods that fall within the same time horizon but I have yet to implement the other two stages.</p>
